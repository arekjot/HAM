  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi there! My name is Arek, and my callsign is SP7AJ. I'm located in Łódź, Poland.</p>  
  <p>I'm passionate about almost everything in ham radio, but CW, DXing and QRP are my favorites. CW is my main working mode and HF are fav bands. You can also hear me on VHF/UHF, mostly ragchewing locally or testing equipment.</p>  
  <p>Speaking of equipment, I love collecting vintage ham radio gear, especially handhelds from the '80s and '90s. My collection is small but growing!</p> 
  <p>As the layout suggests, I'm also a fan of retro vibes in general – electronics or internet alike.</p>  
  <p><strong>Member of CWOps (#3496) and SP DX Club (#976)</strong></p>  
  <p>Looking forward to hearing you on the bands!</p>
