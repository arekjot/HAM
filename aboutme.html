    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Arek SP7AJ, living in Lodz, Poland. I'm passionate about almost everything about ham radio, but DXing and CW is what captivated my heart.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy the retro side of the hobby, so I like to collect old equipment and some books.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you on the bands, VY 73!</p>
