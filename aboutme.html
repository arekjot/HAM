        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Arek, and my callsign is SP7AJ. I'm located in Łódź, Poland.</p>  
        <p>I'm passionate about almost everything in ham radio, but CW, DXing and QRP is something that I like the most.  
        CW is my main working mode and HF are fav bands. However, you can also hear me on VHF/UHF, mostly ragchewing locally or testing my equipment.</p>  
        <p>Speaking of equipment, that’s another chapter - I love collecting vintage ham radio gear, especially handhelds from the '80s and '90s. My collection is yet small, but I hope it will only keep growing!</p> 
        <p>As the layout of this page may suggest, I'm also a fan of retro vibes in general - whether related to electronics or the internet. </p>  
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>I'm also a proud member of CWOps (#3496) and SP DX Club (#976).</strong></p>  

        <p>Looking forward to hearing you on the bands and I hope you like my page!</p>
